# Arrays & Loops Activity

Start by forking and cloning this repository down to your computer.

Questions and expected output are located in the [client.js](./client.js) file. Each answer must contain a loop (for or while). You will need loops, conditionals, variables, push and pop.

Take turns driving! The focus of this activity is practice and understanding - this assignment will not be graded. It's OK if you don't finish and all members of your team may turn in the same code for this assignment.
